# DKvsDS
Das Kase vs Das Schildkrote is a project game open source developped from a project from something i did in techno class
# The Goal of the Game 
The Goal is to kill all of the Kase or win in time. This game is actually developped in scratch, but i plane to code it in C++ or in an another language.
I create soon a discord for the people who want it for develop the game, for improve the code and recreate it in an another language like i said.
# Open source project, why ?
First, my project is developped in Scratch, so all the people who want to see the code can if they want to retake or recreate an another game with. Dont forgot to tag my github for that, that would be great.
# BausenGames, who we are ?
We are two person who are passsionate on create videogames or code. This is our first project, so dont be rude :)
